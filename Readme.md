# Bpsk(binary phase shift keying):<br/>
## Description:<br/>
It is a type of phase shift keying modulation ,mainly it is based on sending the information within the   phase of the carrier (sin or cosine).It involves changing the phase of the transmitted waveform instead of the frequency, and these finite phase changes represent digital data. In its simplest form, a phase-modulated waveform can be generated by using the digital data to switch between two signals of equal frequency but opposing phase. If the resultant waveform is multiplied by a sine wave of equal frequency, two components are generated: one cosine waveform of double the received frequency and one frequency-independent term whose amplitude is proportional to the cosine of the phase shift. Thus, filtering out the higher-frequency term yields the original modulating data prior to transmission.bpsk is called binary since it uses two phases.

# Qpsk(Quadratre phase shift keying):<br/>
## Description:<br/>
It is a type of phase shift keying modulation ,mainly it is based on sending the information within the phase of the carrier (sin or cosine).It involves changing the phase of the transmitted waveform instead of the frequency, and these finite phase changes represent digital data. In its simplest form, a phase-modulated waveform can be generated by using the digital data to switch between two signals of equal frequency but opposing phase. If the resultant waveform is multiplied by a sine wave of equal frequency, two components are generated: one cosine waveform of double the received frequency and one frequency-independent term whose amplitude is proportional to the cosine of the phase shift. Thus, filtering out the higher-frequency term yields the original modulating data prior to transmission.QPSK is called Quadratre since it uses 4 phases.
With QPSK, the carrier undergoes four changes in phase (four symbols) and can thus represent 2 binary bits of data per symbol.

# Fsk(Frequency shift keying):<br/><br/>
## Description:<br/>
It is a type of frequency modulation ,it differs from analog FM by using a digital signal as the input to the frequency modulator, the information is conveyed also through the phase of the signal but depending on the frequency variation this time. Thus, the output takes the form of a sine wave at two distinct frequencies. To demodulate this waveform, it is a simple matter of passing the signal through two filters and translating the resultant back into logic levels.

# QAM(Quadrature amplitude modulation):<br/>
## Description:<br/>
It conveys two analog message signals, or two digital bit streams, by changing (modulating) the amplitudes of two carrier waves, using the amplitude-shift keying (ASK) digital modulation scheme or amplitude modulation (AM) analog modulation scheme. The two carrier waves of the same frequency are out of phase with each other by 90Â°, a condition known as orthogonality and as quadrature. Being the same frequency, the modulated carriers add together, but can be coherently separated (demodulated) because of their orthogonality property.
